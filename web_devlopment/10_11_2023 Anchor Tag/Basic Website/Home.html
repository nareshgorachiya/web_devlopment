		<p>Tunic is a 2022 action-adventure game developed by Isometricorp Games and published by Finji. It is set in a ruined fantasy world, where the player controls an anthropomorphic fox on a journey to free a fox spirit trapped in a crystal. The player discovers the gameplay and setting by exploring and finding in-game pages of a manual that offers clues, drawings, and notes. The backstory is obscured in a constructed writing system, and there are numerous hidden pathways. Designer Andrew Shouldice developed Tunic, his first major game, over seven years.</p>
